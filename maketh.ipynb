Despite this, we adore the Sacred Box. As it is Sacred, we *must* not question it, but rather observe. What happens when we put a different word into the Sacred Box? What if we put a recieved output back into the Sacred Box? Let us be guided by the box. Put in the pieces of paper, close the box, and shake it.\n",

That is because, in the eyes of the Sacred Box, all inputs are the same (we have much to learn from the Sacred Box). Furthermore, we are now certain that it can **only** convert inputs into gibberish. This is okay. The Sacred Box is sacred, and has endured much, therefore we will always adore it. Notice how putting in a different word converted that word to another seemingly random sequence of characters.  It is important to understand that **whenever the same word is entered into the Sacred Box, the resulting output will always be the same**.\n",

Let's see an implementation of this in Python. Luckily for us Python has a package in the Standard Library that includes a number of hash functions."

    "## Transactions\n",
    "Hashes are an essential part of Bitcoin. After seralization, each transaction undergoes two rounds of the same hash function ([sha256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)) that we used in our cryptocurrency to create a **Transaction Identifier (TXID)**. When working with systems of scale, much like Bitcoin, fractions of seconds come into play. A transaction sometimes contains too much data for it to be passed between nodes effectively (too many bits). Bitcoin uses a hash function to remap the data to a fixed length to serve the same general purpose that the blockchain needs. We use hashes because they are one way functions. It is easy to compute the output of a hash funciton given its input, but it is very difficult (read: impossible, probably) to obtain the input of a hash function given the output (the hash function itself cannot compute it). Transactions gain a layer of security and efficiency when we hash its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bitcoin, transactions are just records that a wallet was decreased of a certain balance and that another wallet was increased of that same balance. This is comprised of:\n",
    "- A spender, who will sign the transaction\n",
    "- A number of inputs, which are other transactions' outputs. The recipient of all those should be the spender's wallet, otherwise you could spend other people's money.\n",
    "- A number of outputs, each of which specify an amount of money and a recipient"
