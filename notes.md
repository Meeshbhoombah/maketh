## Current System
- Alan wants to send Mitchell Money
    1. Alan calls his bank manager and says, "transfer $1000 to Mitchell"
    2. Bank Manager checks Alan's balance to see if he has enough
        - Alan has made millions off people waiving their hands over a magic metal bar (enough)
- Makes an entry in the registar 
```
Alan -> Mitchell .... AMOUNT: $1000
```
- Trusted bank to manage money
    + Phyical money was never moved
- All that was need was entry in registar (controlled by neither Alan nor Mitchell)
    + Issue: to establish trust between two parties = depend on individual third
    + What's the problem?
        - Singular in number - all it takes is one rogue agent to cripple the system
    + What if...
        1. Registar burn down?
        2. Account manager accidentally wrote down $1500 instead of $1000?
        3. What if he did it on purpose?
    + Could there be a system without a bank?
- Only if we manage the registry ourselves
    + What if we did?
    + Maintain the registry ourselves
